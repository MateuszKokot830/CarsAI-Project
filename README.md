# CarsAI-Project
Self-learning Cars with Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm (project for Biologically Inspired Artificial Intelligence course in sem. VI).
Cars are using Neural Network (6 input, 6 hidden and 2 output layers) in order to learn how to avoid collisions with obstacles, the screen and how to get to the finish zone. On the inputs in neural network there are 5 possible crash distances + the distance to finish zone and by the output car can turn either turn left, turn right or do nothing. After each generation the program chooses the best car that becomes parent for next generation. Crossover and mutations are performed and each generation tries to obtain a better result.
